# **Introducing JPX**

#### So what is JSX exactly :thinking:

Well it's a Javascript Syntax Extension, that follows with creating the react app [1.0 Create-React-App](./1.0%20create-react-app.md)
You can look at JSX as your friendly Neighborhood Extension :sloth: But in all honesty what JSX does is take the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic, for example how events are handled, or how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.

React doesn't run on JSX though, you mostly use it as a visual representation of the file type, to indicate it's a JSX component, or it at least uses JSX. One common pattern I've seen personally is that they name components JSX, or files where they know JSX syntax is going to be implemented.

Well let's get started before you start doing Docker :whale:

## How to attach Expressions in JSX

In JSX we can use curly brackets, yes these bastards **{}** to implement Javascript Expressions. How do we do that?
