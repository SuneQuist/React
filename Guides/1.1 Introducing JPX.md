# **Introducing JPX**

## So what is JSX exactly :thinking:

Well it's a Javascript Syntax Extension, that follows with creating the react app [1.0 Create-React-App](./1.0%20create-react-app.md)
You can look at JSX as your friendly Neighborhood Extension, but in all honesty what JSX does is take the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic, for example how events are handled, or how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.

React doesn't run on JSX though, you mostly use it as a visual representation of the file type, to indicate it's a JSX component, or it at least uses JSX. One common pattern I've seen personally is that they name components JSX, or files where they know JSX syntax is going to be implemented.

Well let's get started before you start doing Docker :whale:

## How to attach Expressions in JSX

In JSX we can use curly brackets, yes these bastards **{}** to implement Javascript Expressions. How do we do that?

```js
    const name = 'Sune Quist';
    const element = <h2>{name}</h2>
```

#### Yes, it's really that easy.

To get the right mindset you need to always think that when using brackets, it's for declaring basic **Javascript Syntax** and nothing more.
You will mostly see these curly brackets in the **React DOM**, where you return the HTML you coded.

```js
    const showUser = () => {

        const user = {
            firstName: 'Sune',
            lastname: 'Quist,
        };

        return (
            <h2>
                Welcome {user.firstName + ' ' + user.lastName}!
            </h2>
        );
    };
```

***Note:*** As you may have noticed the object's last value has a **,** at the end, I usually do this myself so I don't have to come back later and set it again, it's also being nice so when other people go in and maybe forget to add it, it will spare them the trouble looking for the comma that they forgot to set after adding a new key-value pair to the object.

# JSX can be even cooler?

JPX can also be used inside elements and even be mapped plus many other awesome things!

### Mapping an array in the DOM

```js
    function Home() {
        const mapMePlease = [
            {id: 1, firstName: 'Mark', lastName: 'Zuckerberg'},
            {id: 2, firstName: 'Dan', lastName: 'Abramov'},
            {id: 3, firstName: 'Sune', lastName: 'Quist'},
        ]

        return (
            <Mapped mapMePlease={mapMePlease} />
        );
    };

    const Mapped = props => {
        return (
            <ul className="im-a-list">
                {
                    props.mapMePlease.map(arr => (
                        <li key={arr.id}>Welcome {arr.firstName + ' ' + arr.lastName}!</li>
                    ))
                }
            </ul>
        );
    };
```


#### This snippet would give you something like this in the DOM.
```txt
    Welcome Mark Zuckerberg!

    Welcome Dan Abramov!

    Welcome Sune Quist!
```

So how does this work? Well, we pass an object as props to our Mapped React Component, and then we use some Javascript Syntax to perform a mapping over the array we got from the Home Component. That's how you run through an array with JSX! Awesome right? Well I still have one thing left to show you before we go ahead and end of this chapter.

### Embedding Elements

```js
    const displayGif = () => {
        const gifUrl = 'https://media.giphy.com/media/l2Sqir5ZxfoS27EvS/giphy.gif';

        return (
            <p align="center">
                <img src={gifUrl} alt="Nailed it!" />
            </p>
        );
    };
```

In this snippet you can see we use the constant variable **gifUrl** abd embed it onto the img src, it's damn awesome right? Well I think we Nailed this chapter :clap:
