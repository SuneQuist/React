# **Creating The React App**

### `The create-react-app is a single-step operation, that only runs one time.`

---

**Npm:** stands for Node Package Manager, and is what most uses to install external packages, made by other users. There is also a package called **Yarn**, but that is for another time.

**Npx:** stands for Node Package Execute, and came out with the **5.2.0** or above update of **npm**. Npx is a *npm package* runner that executes any package without even installing the package, this is why it's also mainly used to install create-react-app instead of npm nowadays.
