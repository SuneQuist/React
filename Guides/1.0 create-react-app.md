# **Creating The React App**

### `The create-react-app is a single-step operation, that only runs one time.`

---

> **Npm:** stands for Node Package Manager, and is what most uses to install external packages, made by other users. There is also a package called **Yarn**, but that is for another time.

> **Npx:** stands for Node Package Execute, and came out with the **5.2.0** or above update of **npm**. Npx is a *npm package* runner that executes any package without even installing the package, this is why it's also mainly used to install create-react-app instead of npm nowadays.

### Now that we know what **npm** and **npx** is, let's get get to the juicy stuff, you've all been waiting for :monocle_face: <br/><br/>

### Do I have Node :thinking:

**Install:** [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/)

It is important that you have already installd *Node.js* Latest version, or else npm will not be availabe, you can check if you have **node** and **npm** like this.
> **Node Version:** node -v

> **Npm Version:** npm -v

### How to create-react-app

Create React App is executed with *npx*, well except for when the weird kid down at the corner, who keeps shouting ***"Use Yarn!"*** :mask: <br/><br/>
The **app name** will become the new *projects folder name*, so make sure you don't create the app inside an already existing folder unless you want to create a new project inside an already existing folder.

There are a few **rules** concerning the name of your applications. These are for example not allowed:
-  Syntax names (like React)
- Uppercase names
- SpacesInTheNames

#### Now that we have clarified all of this it's time to execute the name:
```bash
    npx create-react-app name
```

**Notice:** Remember to always be in the folder you want to create your app in.
> **Find Folder:** cd desktop/my-new-project

> **Go Back One Folder:** cd ..

Now that we have created the app, how about we take a look? Jump into the folder you just created, and execute the command **npm start** inside the folder. 
> **Jump Into New Folder:** cd name

>**Open the Editor:** code .

>**Start the app:** npm start
<br/>

### Now let's continue to infinity and beyond! :milky_way:
