# **Creating The React App**

### `The create-react-app is a single-step operation, that only runs one time.`

---

> **Npm:** stands for Node Package Manager, and is what most uses to install external packages, made by other users. There is also a package called **Yarn**, but that is for another time.

> **Npx:** stands for Node Package Execute, and came out with the **5.2.0** or above update of **npm**. Npx is a *npm package* runner that executes any package without even installing the package, this is why it's also mainly used to install create-react-app instead of npm nowadays.

#### Now that we know what **npm** and **npx** is, let's get get to the juicy stuff, you've all been waiting for :monocle_face: <br/><br/>

### How to create-react-app

#### Create React App is executed with npx, well except for when the weird kid down at the corner, who keeps shouting "Use Yarn!" :mask: <br/>
#### The app name will become the new projects folder name, so make sure you don't create the app inside an already existing folder unless you want to create a new project inside an already existing folder.

#### The are a few rules concerning the names of your applications though. These are for example not allowed:
-  Syntax names (like React)
- Uppercase names
- SpacesInTheNames
#### Well you execute the command like this:
```bash
    npx create-react-app [name]
```

**Notice:** Remember to always be in the folder you want to create your app in.
> **Find Folder:** cd desktop/my-new-project

> **Go Back One Folder:** cd ..
