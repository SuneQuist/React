[Exporting](https://github.com/SuneQuist/React/blob/main/Guides/1.2%20Export%20and%20Import.md#exporting) and [Importing](https://github.com/SuneQuist/React/blob/main/Guides/1.2%20Export%20and%20Import.md#importing) is a common thing, and not only for programming, but it's also formally used to export files out of the program so that you can use the files elsewhere or import them into the file or program you're currently working in, to continue working on them.

***Note:*** This is a guide for programming though, so we won't be going over how to export or import in other programs, but it should be fairly simple :monocle_face:

Well exporting, and importing are going to be different depending on the program you're currently using. For example, if we were to compare Node.js and React.js it would look around something like this in comparison.

#### Exporting example
#### Node
```js
    const name = 'Sune';
    module.exports = name;
```

#### React
```js
    const name = 'Sune';
    export name;
```
<br/>
As you can see the difference is there, and that is why we will only be focusing on React in this chapter. Now that we have that out of the way let's begin.

## Exporting

In React there are a few ways you can export, for example, named-, mixed-, and default export as well be going over in this section of the chapter.

### Named Exporting

Named exporting is the most common one, we declare a variable with a name (key) and sends it off, but there's the question of how do we then export multiple named variables, without having to write the line **export name** a thousand times.

#### How we export a single variable/fucntion
```js
    // Exporting a function
    export function Name() {};

    // Exporting a named function
    export const Name = () => {};

    // Exporting a single variable
    const name = 'Sune';
    export name;
```
<br/>
Now that we know how to export a single named variable/function, let's get to how we export multiple at once.

#### How we export multiple variables/functions
```js
    // Exporting multiple functions at once
    export function FirstName() {};
    export function LastName() {};

    // Exporting multiple named functions at once
    const FirstName = () => {};
    const FastName = () => {};

    export { FirstName, LastName ;

    // Exporting multiple variables at once
    const firstName = 'Sune';
    const lastName = 'Quist';

    export { firstName, lastName };
```
<br/>
You may have wondered, "Why are there two functions with export in front, why not just reference them?", well, to be honest, the reason is pretty bland, we normally don't write the files too long, or else they would get hard to read at one point, or have an overall look at. That's why it's recommended to just export them on the spot, so it had 100 functions in a single file, we wouldn't have to remember all their names and reference them, instead just reference them at the spot.

### Mixed Exporting

Mixed is exporting is quite like-named exporting, this when we refer to an object rather than a primitive type. I hope that was easy enough to understand :vulcan_salute:

#### Exporting a mixed variable
```js
    const mixed = {
        firstName: 'Sune',
        lastName: 'Quist',
        age: 18
    }
```
<br/>
This is equivalent to, named exporting.

#### Exporting a mixed variable as a named variable
```js
    const firstName = 'Sune';
    const lastName = 'Quist';
    const age = 18;

    export {
        firstName,
        lastName,
        age
    }
```
<br/>

**These two snippets are the same.**

### Default Exporting

What's Default exporting? **SIMPLE** it is when exporting something from a file, and that thing is its default value? :anger:
Well to put it straight, it's the highest priority export from that file, or rather when you refer to that file via importing, the value that will get **returned** without using *Curly Brackets* is the default value, if no default value is returned from the file *Curly Brackets* are needed.

***Note:*** Curly Brackets are these **{}** :wink:

Another important thing is there can only be one **Default** export per file.

#### Default Exporting
```js
    // Default exporting a funciton
    export default function Name() {};

    // Default exporting named funtions
    const Name = () => {};
    export default Name;

    // Default exporint a named variable
    const name = 'Sune';
    export default name;
```
<br/>

That is how you *export default*. We stated that name functions are the same as named variables, and in this case, it also works the same.

### That was how you export! Quite interesting right?
## Importing

Pffft easy right? Well, let's get serious now again, and learn about importing.

Importing is much like exporting though here we import the files to use them. *Simple* right? You would think that, but tons of people have problems importing since they don't know how routing works. Well, that's why I'm here to tell you how that works :thinking:

So before we go into importing in files/documents, I will quickly teach you how routing works.

Routing can be done one way, by searching up the file you want to use, **BINGO!** there's the problem. People don't know how to search up files, well some don't.
To Search up files, you need to know the structure of the folder you're working in, and how to navigate around it.

**The DOT Notaion**
```terminal
    ./ (dot slash) means you're pointing to the folder you're currently in.
    ../ (dot dot slash) means you're going back one folder.
```
I always recommend using the **DOT Notation** (this is not the actual name for it!) even if you're in the folder you need, and you just want a different file in the folder, **DO NOT!** refer to it like this *name.js*, this is not a good way and can often cause an error, where you then have to search for that error.

Imagine a folder structure like this:
```terminal
Src
    User
        user.js
        name.js

    Account
        billing.js
```

#### Routing example using the folder structure above :point_up_2:
```js
    // Were currently in the user.js file

    // Here we want the name
    import './name.js';

    // Here we want the billing
    import '../account/billing.js;
```

I hope that clarified a bit more on how to use **The DOT Notation**, and will be useful for you in the future.

## How to import

Importing is essential for you if you want to work with React. Therefore it's one of the first things I will teach you in this Guide.
There are a few ways to import in React, and it can be boiled down to, default-, named-, and renaming importing. Now let's go over them :fire:

### Default Importing

Default importing is when you import a [Default Export](https://github.com/SuneQuist/React/blob/main/Guides/1.2%20Export%20and%20Import.md#default-exporting).
As we stated before in the **Default Export** section, we refer to the default export when importing the file, so when we export something with the keyword *export default* that becomes the file's default value when imported.

Here's a little example of how we import default exports.

#### Importing a Default Export
```js
    // Different document
    export default function FirstName() {};

    // Importing from other document
    import FirstName from './differentDocument.js';
```
___

### Named Importing

Now how do you import a [Named Export](https://github.com/SuneQuist/React/blob/main/Guides/1.2%20Export%20and%20Import.md#named-exporting)?
It's close to the same way we export a named or mixed variable, rather multiple of them.

You can import as many of the exported files as you need from the other document. We can also import the default while importing the other exports.

#### Importing named variables
```js
    // Exporting from a different document
    export default function FullName() {};

    const FirstName = () => {};
    const lastName = 'Quist';

    export { FirstName, lastName };

    // Importing from other docuement

    // Importing single docuement
    import { FirstName } from './differentDocuement.js';

    // Importing multiple
    import { FirstName, lastName } from './differentDocuement.js';

    // Import default and multiple documents
    import FullName, { Firstname, lastName } from './differentDocument.js';
```
___

### Renaming Imports

Renaming imports can be useful sometimes, but it's not recommended though, especially not if the name of the variable/function is already clear. This method is mostly used when you have multiple exports and need to refer to them all, via a specific function. For example, using a switch case, you could have them all be passed down as actions. something, and then say if the actions. something is a specific name, execute this function or something along those lines.

This example above :point_up_2: can also be referred to as a simple Redux, using either context or not :eyes:

#### How to rename imports
```js
    // Exporting from a different document
    export default function FullName() {};

    const FirstName = () => {};
    const lastName = 'Quist';

    export { FirstName, lastName };

    // Importing from other document

    // Renaming all exports from differentDocument.js to actions
    import FullName, * as actions from './differentDocument.js';

    // Renaming single export names
    import { FirstName as Name, lastName } from './differentDocument.js';
```

When you import and change the **\*** to actions, it doesn't mean that all their names now will be actions, it means that they all become methods of actions.

```js
    // Renaming all exports from differentDocument.js to actions
    import FullName, * as actions from './differentDocument.js';

    // How to use the export now
    let name = actions.lastName; // let name will now be equal to 'Quist';
```
