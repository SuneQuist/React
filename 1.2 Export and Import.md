# Export and Import

Exporting and Importing is a common thing, and not only for programming, but it's also formally used to export files out of the program so that you can use the files elsewhere or import them into the file or program you're currently working in, to continue working on them.

This is a guide for programming though, so we won't be going over how to export or import in other programs, but it should be fairly simple.

Well exporting, and importing are going to be different depending on the program you're currently using. For example, if we were to compare Node.js and React.js it would look around something like this in comparison.

#### Exporting example
#### Node
```js
    const name = 'Sune';
    module.exports = name;
```

#### React
```js
    const name = 'Sune';
    export name;
```

As you can see the difference is there, and that is why we will only be focusing on React in this chapter. Now that we have that out of the way let's begin.
